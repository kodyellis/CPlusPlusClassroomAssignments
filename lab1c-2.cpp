/* Problem Description: The manager of a TU Games Online wants you 
     to design a web site that takes customer orders. There are three
     types of games sold on the website  Madden NFL, Call of Duty,
     and Halo. When the customer visits the video gamerâ€™s web site, 
     it asks the user to enter the number of games ordered in each 
     of the three categories. The price per game is shown in 
     the chart below:


      Game Type                   Cost per game
        Madden NFL                    $59.99
        Call of Duty (package)        $179.99
        Halo                          $99.99


Next, calculate and print the total sale amount, the total number of 
games purchased, and the average cost per game. Display the results 
in the format shown below: 

 
Total Number of Games Purchased: XXXX
Total Sale Amount: $YYY.YY
Average cost per game: $ZZZ.Z
