Movie Watching information. For each student, read in the in the number 
of movies he or she has watched in the last 12 months, the amount of 
money spent on watching these movies, and the preferred way to watch 
movies (C/c-cable TV, I/i-Internet Service (i.e. Netflix, Amazon ), 
D/d-Buy/Rent DVD, or S/s-stop). Continue to prompt for user input until 
the user enters Stop for the preferred method to watch movies. 


Calculate and display the following:

The number of students who prefer to buy or rent DVDs.
Average number of movies watched by students in the last 12 months 
(accurate to 1 decimal place)
The percent of students who spend over $75 on movie watching.
